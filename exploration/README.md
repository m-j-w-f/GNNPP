## 🚧 missing_data.ipynb

This notebook analyses when and which data is missing.
Only `sm_mean` and `sm_var` are missing, however in 2014 there is a substantial amount missing, since none of the stations reported any data on these two variables.

Also stations near the cost are missing `sm_mean` and `sm_var` more often than stations inland stations.
