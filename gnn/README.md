# 🕸️ Graph Neural Network Experiments

Files related to the implementation, training and evaluation of GNNs<br>
🚨 Note that "ResGat" is often called "ResGnn", and "MPWGI" is often called "GlobalInfo" in this entire codebase.

## 📁 plots

Various plots to evaluate the performance of GNNs

## 📁 Gridsearch_Resuls

Visualizations of the results of the gridsearch

## 📁 experiments

Config files for different experiments using GNNs.
```large``` and  ```small``` hold the best config files for GraphSAGE, ResGAT, and MPWGI found by a grid search.
```eff_of_hyperparameters``` holds the config files used for testing the sensitivity of certain hyperparameters.
```plots``` is used to store the visualizations of the results of the sensitivity testing.

## 📁 checkpoints

is used to store the checkpoints generated by gnn.ipynb

## ⚡️ ensemble_train.py

Called by 🔬 ensemble_test.ipynb to train an ensemble based on a config file

## 🔬 ensemble_test.ipynb

Evaluate the performance of an ensemble, which is specified by a config file

## 🧠 ensemble_explain.ipynb

Permutation- and gradient-based explaining of a trained GNN.

## 🎛️ ensemble_eff_of_hyperparameters.ipynb

Evaluate the performance when varying certain hyperparameters

## 🧪 gnn.ipynb

General experimentation with GNNs, first test of code, no results are produced here, only for experimentation

## 👀 Gridsearch.ipynb

Used to run a grid search with [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai)

## 🪄 models.py

The different GNNs (GraphSAGE, ResGAT, and MPWGI) are defined here.
